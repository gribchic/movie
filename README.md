#Programming Task
Our fictional partner DaMovies wants to give TV viewers a really simple solution where they can
browse and rent movies directly on their TV.
For simplicity, we’ll use the keyboard instead of a remote control in this case. We’ll use the arrows
`[up]`, `[down]`, `[left]`, `[right]`. For OK we’ll use `[enter]` and to navigate back, we use the character `[b]`.
The user should be able to choose a genre, navigate through movie posters, and pick a movie to read
more about it.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
